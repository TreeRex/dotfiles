# Tree's .files

This repo contains the dot files I use on my Macbook. There is script to create the appropriate symlinks into $HOME, as I haven't been sharing these configs with other boxen.

These aren't documented. They rely on conventions I (mostly) adhere to when installing software. All in all they are here so they don't get lost.

My [emacs configuration](https://github.com/TreeRex/emacs.d) is also on Github.
